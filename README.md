## Description
66% of Americans are on prescription drugs (source), and a common ponderance of this group is “What should I take now that I’m sick?” From all the terminology to the inability to easily contact a medical provider, or the unavailability of pharmacists, it’s easy to get lost in the mess.

Our solution uses an existing database of Drug-Drug interactions combined with a compiled list of doctor recommendations for OTC drugs for common ailments (allergies, colds, food poisoning, etc.) to see what can and cannot be taken. As well as what one can or cannot do while on these drugs (drink, eat certain foods, etc.).
